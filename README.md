# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Project involves analysing and predicting customer churn. Churning, or customer attrition, is the loss of a customer. Customers who churn result in revenue loss, as generally it is considered less expensive for a company to keep an existing customer than to convert a new customer.

For this project we seek to predict churn in Telco Customers. Specifically, the project involves a lengthy exploration of the data set to pick up and/or reveal any relationships between our target variable and the other variables in the dat set. We then seek to begin modelling, with the goal of finding a model that can most accurately classify if a customer has churned. having said this, we specifcally are looking for a model that is suitably accurate across the board, correctly classifying the target variable in both directions (determined via recall, precision, and f1 score) and has a high recall
